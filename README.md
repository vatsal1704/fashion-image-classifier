# Fashion Image Classifier

## Project Description

This project is a deep learning-based image classification system designed to identify various types of clothing items using the Fashion MNIST dataset. It serves as a foundational example of applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to computer vision tasks in the fashion domain.

## Dataset Used

The classifier uses the **Fashion MNIST** dataset provided by [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist). The dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories, with 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is 28x28 pixels, representing items such as sneakers, shirts, and bags.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture includes:

- Input layer for 28x28 grayscale images
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Max pooling layers for dimensionality reduction
- Fully connected (Dense) layers for classification
- Softmax output layer with 10 units (one for each class)
